    <!-- Let's use async and await to work with promises more conveniently and make the code easier to understand. The async and await keywords provide a way to work with promises using a more synchronous-looking code structure.

Explanation of async and await
async Function:

A function defined with the async keyword always returns a promise. Within this function, you can use await to pause execution until a promise is resolved.
await:

await pauses the execution of the async function and waits for the promise to resolve. Once resolved, it returns the result of the promise. It can only be used inside an async function. -->
